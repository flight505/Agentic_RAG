# Your rule content

- [cli.py](mdc:src/agentic_rag/cli.py) is for the cli 
- [rag_system.py](mdc:src/agentic_rag/rag_system.py) is for the Agentic RAG system the we are building
- When making substantial changes to the [rag_system.py](mdc:src/agentic_rag/rag_system.py) or [cli.py](mdc:src/agentic_rag/cli.py) we should update the tests [test_rag_system.py](mdc:tests/test_rag_system.py) or [test_cli.py](mdc:tests/test_cli.py)
- When making substantial changes to the [rag_system.py](mdc:src/agentic_rag/rag_system.py) or [cli.py](mdc:src/agentic_rag/cli.py) we should update the [README.md](mdc:README.md) to reflect the changes and keep it updated.
- We are working on a Macbook Pro M3 MAX 64GB shared memory and should take advantage of mps when posible, but at the same time the Agentic RAG system should work on multiple platforms.
